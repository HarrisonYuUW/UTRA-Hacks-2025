# UTRA Hacks 2025

**Background**  
Over the last century, robotics has made huge strides by excelling in controlled environments such as factory floors. However, today’s world demands more dynamic and adaptive machines that can operate amid uncertainty—varying surfaces, shifting obstacles, and unexpected interactions with other moving objects. Robots must now detect, decide, and act on the fly in ever-changing conditions to tackle real-world challenges.

**Challenge Overview**  
In this year’s closed challenge, using their Arduino-based kits and only the supplemental materials provided in the hardware kit. Teams must design a robot to interpret colour-coded floor markers and use its sensors to accomplish three challenging courses.

**Project Details** 

Our autonomous robot is designed to tackle multiple challenges, including color detection, maze navigation, and color pattern recognition. It uses an Arduino Uno R4, motors, and sensors to navigate complex environments, detect colors, and place flags at designated locations. With obstacle avoidance capabilities and a pattern-matching system, the robot efficiently interprets and responds to its surroundings, making it a versatile solution for autonomous exploration.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Challenge Capability**: Completes three autonomous challenges:
  - Color detection and flag placement
  - Maze navigation
  - Color pattern recognition
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses sensors and programmed logic to navigate through color-coded mazes while avoiding obstacles.
- **Color Pattern Recognition**: Detects and matches color sequences to given patterns.
- **Flag Placement Mechanism**: Identifies designated areas and plants flags accurately.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Uses sensors to detect and avoid walls or objects during movement.

### Hardware Components
- **Arduino Uno R4**: Central microcontroller handling sensor data and motor control.
- **JGA25-370 Gearmotors**: Drives the robot's movement with precision.
- **L298 Motor Driver**: Controls the power distribution to motors.
- **TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor**: Detects floor tile colors for pattern recognition and navigation.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures distance to detect obstacles and walls.
- **Claw Assembly**: Mechanism for flag placement at designated locations.
- **Battery Pack**: Provides power to the system for untethered operation.

### Software Components
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for programming the microcontroller.
- **Custom Navigation Algorithm**: Implements pathfinding and decision-making logic.
- **Color Detection Algorithm**: Processes RGB sensor data for accurate color recognition.
- **Motor Control Logic**: Ensures precise movements, turns, and speed adjustments.
- **Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm**: Uses ultrasonic sensor readings to prevent collisions.
- **Pattern Matching System**: Compares detected colors with a predefined sequence to validate patterns.

### Future Enhancements
- **Optimize Algorithms**: Improve execution speed and efficiency.
- **Enhanced Obstacle Avoidance**: Use additional sensors for more accurate detection.
- **Energy Efficiency Improvements**: Optimize power consumption for longer runtime.
- **Expanded Sensor Integration**: Incorporate new sensors to interact with more complex environments.
